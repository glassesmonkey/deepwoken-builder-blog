                <p>
                    Let's break it down, shall we?
                </p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Shields</th>

                <h2>Offhand Mechanics: The Nitty-Gritty</h2>
                <p>
                    Time for some big brain energy (don't worry, we'll keep it fun):
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Posture: Shields increase your posture, making you harder to stagger</li>
                    <li>Dual-Wielding: Offhand weapons match the swing speed of your main weapon</li>
                    <li>Blocking: Shields can block attacks, but watch out for guard breaks!</li>
                    <li>Stat Requirements: Most offhand gear needs some investment in FTD or LHT</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Pro Strats for Offhand Masters</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mix and Match: Try different main weapon and offhand combos</li>
                    <li>Know When to Block: Timing is everything with shields</li>
                    <li>Use Your Environment: Shields are great for navigating hazards</li>
                    <li>Surprise Attacks: Use offhand weapons to catch enemies off-guard</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Fun Offhand Facts</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Targe is the starter shield - it's like the tutorial of the shield world</li>
                    <li>Some talents and mantras require shields. It's like they're playing favorites!</li>
                    <li>Offhand guns do reduced damage when paired with non-light weapons. Balancing is hard, okay?</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Conclusion: Embrace the Power of the Other Hand!</h2>
