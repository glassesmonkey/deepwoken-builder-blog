                    Elemental weapons in Deepwoken are like regular weapons that went to Hogwarts. Here's why they're awesome:
                </p>
                <ul>

                </ul>
                
                <h2>The Elemental Weapons Rundown: Nature's Toolbox</h2>

                    Time for some big brain energy (but don't worry, we'll keep it fun):
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scaling: Often scales with both a weapon stat (like MED or HVY) AND an elemental stat</li>
                    <li>Special Effects: Each element has unique status effects (burn, freeze, shock, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Elemental Damage: Bypass some physical defenses and hit those sweet elemental weaknesses</li>
                    <li>Coolness Factor: Immeasurable. Scientists are still trying to quantify it</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Pro Strats for Elemental Weapon Users</h2>
                <ul>
