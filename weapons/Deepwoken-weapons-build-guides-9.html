                <h2>Record-Breaking Weapons: The Overachievers of Deepwoken</h2>
                
                <p>Let's start with some mind-blowing records. These weapons aren't just good; they're the best at what they do!</p>
                
                <h3>The Heavy Hitters Club</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>üèÜ Highest Base Damage: Hivelord's Hubris and Divine Greatsword (30 damage) - These bad boys hit harder than your mom when she found out you failed math.</li>
                    <li>üèÜ Highest Stat Requirement: Hivelord's Hubris (100 HVY) - It's like the weapon equivalent of "You must be this tall to ride."</li>
                    <li>üèÜ Highest Dual Requirement: Hivelord's Hubris (100 HVY, 60 STR) - For when you want your weapon to be as picky as a toddler at dinnertime.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>The Penetration Pros</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>üèÜ Highest Penetration: Shattered Katana, First Light, Nemit's Sickle, Kyrsedge, Kystreza, Flareblood Kamas, Pernarch, Pleeksty's Inferno, Soulthorn, and Nocturne (All at 30%) - These weapons don't just ignore armor; they laugh in its face.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>The Speed Demons</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>üèÜ Highest Swing Speed: Divine Dagger (1.3x) - It's so fast, it makes The Flash look like he's running in slow motion.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Fun Facts That'll Make You Go "Huh, Neat!"</h2>
                
                <p>Now for some random tidbits that'll make you the life of any Deepwoken party (yes, those exist):</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>ü§ì Changing stances doesn't affect swing speed. So, stop doing the weapon cha-cha thinking it'll make you faster!</li>
                    <li>ü§ì The Shotel's 100% chip on crit isn't affected by the obfuscation enchant cap. It's like the rebel of the weapon world.</li>
                    <li>ü§ì Aranea is the first item to have an unobtainable stat prerequisite. It's playing hard to get, and we respect that.</li>
                    <li>ü§ì Hero Blades scale with Proficiency, not Songchant. They're more about practice than poetry.</li>
                    <li>ü§ì Both of the Rifle Basic Attacks have the same range. They're like twins, but with bullets.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Weapon Name Etymology: Because Why Not?</h2>
                
                <p>Ever wondered where some of these wacky weapon names come from? Let's dive in:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>üî§ "Aranea" is Latin for "spider." Maybe it shoots webs? (It doesn't, but wouldn't that be cool?)</li>
                    <li>üî§ "Pernach" is a type of mace from medieval Eastern Europe. The more you know!</li>
                    <li>üî§ "Kyrscleave" sounds like "cursed cleaver" had a baby with "fierce glaive." We're here for it.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>The "Wait, What?" Category</h2>
                
                <p>Some facts are just too weird not to share:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>üò≤ There's a weapon called "Trisha." No, we don't know why. Yes, we love it.</li>
                    <li>üò≤ The "Paintbrush" is an actual weapon. For when you want to paint the town red... literally.</li>
                    <li>üò≤ "Crazy Slots" is a thing. It's like playing weapon roulette, but every chamber is loaded with awesomeness.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Conclusion: Knowledge is Power (and Also Just Really Cool)</h2>
