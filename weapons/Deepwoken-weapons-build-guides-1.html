                <p>
                    Yo, Deepwoken newbies and weapon enthusiasts! 👋 Ready to transform from a clumsy noob into a
                    legendary butt-kicker? Buckle up, because we're about to embark on an epic journey through the wild
                    and wacky world of Deepwoken weapons!
                </p>
                <h2>Deepwoken Weapons 101: Know Your Arsenal</h2>
                <p>
                    In Deepwoken, weapons are like Pokémon - gotta catch 'em all! But instead of cute little monsters,
                    you're collecting tools of destruction. Let's break down the types:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Light Weapons:</strong> These speedy gonzales include daggers, fists, and rapiers.
                        They're faster than your mom when she hears the ice cream truck, but hit like a grumpy kitten.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Medium Weapons:</strong> The Goldilocks of weapons - not too fast, not too slow. Swords,
                        spears, and clubs fall into this category. They're like that friend who's good at everything,
                        annoyingly balanced.</li>
                    <li><strong>Heavy Weapons:</strong> The big kahunas! Greataxes, greatswords, and hammers are here to
                        party. They're slower than a sloth on vacation, but hit harder than reality after college.</li>
                    <li><strong>Elemental Weapons:</strong> These fancy pants come with special powers. It's like your
                        weapon ate a Mario power-up!</li>
                    <li><strong>Offhand Weapons:</strong> The Robin to your Batman. Shields, parry daggers, and even
                        guns can be used offhand. Because two weapons are always better than one, right?</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Weapon Stats: Decoding the Matrix</h2>
                <p>
                    Each weapon in Deepwoken comes with its own set of stats. It's like a dating profile, but for
                    weapons:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Damage:</strong> How much ouchie it does. Higher is better, unless you're into tickle
                        fights.</li>
                    <li><strong>Penetration:</strong> How good it is at ignoring armor. It's like your weapon has x-ray
                        vision!</li>
                    <li><strong>Scaling:</strong> How much stronger it gets as you level up. It's the weapon equivalent
                        of hitting the gym.</li>
                    <li><strong>Weight:</strong> How much posture damage it does. Basically, how good it is at making
                        enemies do the wobble dance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Range:</strong> How far you can bonk from. Because sometimes, you want to hit things
                        from waaaay over there.</li>
                    <li><strong>Swing Speed:</strong> How fast you can swing. Some weapons move like a caffeinated
                        squirrel, others like a sloth doing tai chi.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Weapon Mechanics: The Science of Bonking</h2>
                <p>
                    Now, let's get into the nitty-gritty of how these bad boys work:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Attack Speed:</strong> Calculated as (1/SwingSpeed) ÷ 2. Don't worry, you won't need to
                        do math in the middle of a fight!</li>
                    <li><strong>DPS (Damage Per Second):</strong> Weapon Damage × Swingspeed × 2. For when you really
                        need to know how efficiently you're destroying things.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stances:</strong> Some weapons can be wielded one-handed or two-handed. It's like
                        choosing between eating a burger with one hand or two - it changes the experience!</li>
                    <li><strong>Special Effects:</strong> Some weapons come with cool extras like bleed damage or
                        elemental effects. Because sometimes, just hitting things isn't enough - you want to set them on
                        fire too!</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Pro Strategies for Weapon Selection</h2>
                <p>
                    Alright, future weapon masters, here's how to choose your perfect battle buddy:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Know Your Playstyle:</strong> Are you a hit-and-run ninja or a "stand there and take it"
                        warrior? Choose a weapon that complements your style. Don't be a bull in a china shop if you're
                        built like a twig!</li>
                    <li><strong>Check the Requirements:</strong> Some weapons need you to be buff (high strength) or
                        smart (high intelligence). Don't try to wield a giant hammer if you can barely lift a spoon.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Experiment:</strong> Don't be afraid to try new things. You might discover your inner
                        axe-wielding maniac or realize you're secretly a rapier prodigy!</li>
                    <li><strong>Look for Synergies:</strong> Some weapons work great with certain talents or mantras.
                        It's like finding the perfect cheese for your wine, but deadlier.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consider Your Build:</strong> Planning on being a tanky titan? Maybe avoid the dainty
                        daggers. Want to be a speedy assassin? Perhaps the giant hammer isn't for you (unless you're
                        into irony).</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Fun Weapon Facts to Impress Your Friends</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The weapon with the highest base damage is the Hivelord's Hubris. It's like holding a truck in
                        your hands!</li>
                    <li>Changing stances doesn't affect swing speed. So, no need to do the weapon cha-cha!</li>
                    <li>The Aranea is the first weapon with an unobtainable stat requirement. It's like the popular kid
                        in school - hard to get!</li>
                    <li>You can pass down soulbound weapons for 60 echoes each. It's like weapon inheritance, but
                        cooler.</li>
                    <li>The weapon with the highest swing speed is the Divine Dagger from Crazy Slots. It's faster than
                        your excuses when you're late for work!</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Conclusion: Wield Your Weapon with Pride!</h2>
                <p>
                    There you have it, folks! You're now armed (pun totally intended) with the knowledge to dominate in
                    Deepwoken. Remember, in this game, it's not the size of the weapon that matters, it's how you swing
                    it! Now go forth and bonk with confidence!
                </p>
