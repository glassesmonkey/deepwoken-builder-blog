                <p>
                    What's up, Deepwoken mathmagicians and spreadsheet warriors? ü§ìüó°Ô∏è Ever wondered why your tiny
                    dagger sometimes hits like a truck, or why your massive hammer feels slower than your grandma's
                    internet? Well, grab your calculators and put on your thinking caps, because we're about to dive
                    deep into the nitty-gritty of Deepwoken weapon mechanics!
                </p>

                <h2>Damage Calculation: When Math Meets Mayhem</h2>

                <p>
                    Alright, let's break down how Deepwoken decides just how much "ouchie" your weapon does:
                </p>

                <h3>The Basic Formula</h3>
                <p>
                    For weapons with one scaled attribute (excluding bleed and modifiers), here's the magic formula:
                </p>
                <pre><code>Damage = 0.00075 x {BaseDamage x AttributeScaling x AttributeLevel x [1 + (Proficiency x 0.065)]} + BaseDamage</code></pre>

                <p>Let's break this down for the non-mathlete:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>BaseDamage</strong>: The weapon's starting damage. Think of it as the weapon's
                        "personality".</li>
                    <li><strong>AttributeScaling</strong>: How well the weapon vibes with your stats.</li>
                    <li><strong>AttributeLevel</strong>: Your level in the relevant attribute. Gym time pays off!</li>
                    <li><strong>Proficiency</strong>: Your skill with the weapon. Practice makes perfect!</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Damage Multipliers: Because Basic Math Was Too Easy</h3>
                <p>
                    But wait, there's more! When you factor in damage multipliers:
                </p>
                <pre><code>MultipliedDamage = WeaponDamage x (1 + DamageModifiers%/100)</code></pre>

                <h3>Bleed Damage: Making Your Enemies Leak</h3>
                <p>
                    For our vampire wannabes, here's how bleed damage works:
                </p>
                <pre><code>BleedDamage = WeaponDamage x 1.3</code></pre>
                <p>Or if you want to get fancy with multipliers:</p>
                <pre><code>BleedMultipliedDamage = WeaponDamage x (1 + [DamageModifiers% + 30%]/100)</code></pre>

                <h2>Attack Speed: The Art of Swoosh</h2>

                <p>
                    Ever wondered why some weapons feel like they're moving through molasses? Let's talk attack speed!
                </p>

                <h3>The Speed Formula</h3>
                <p>
                    Here's how to calculate how long it takes for your weapon to go swoosh:
                </p>
                <pre><code>Attack Speed (in seconds) = (1 / SwingSpeed) / 2</code></pre>

                <p>In human speak:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A weapon with 0.5x swing speed takes about 1 second to swing</li>
                    <li>A weapon with 1.0x swing speed takes about 0.5 seconds to swing</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>DPS: For the Spreadsheet Lovers</h3>
                <p>
                    Want to know your Damage Per Second? Here's a simple formula (excluding bleed, endlag, and ping):
                </p>
                <pre><code>DPS = Weapon Damage x SwingSpeed x 2</code></pre>

                <h2>Pro Tips for Weapon Mechanic Mastery</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Balancing Act: High damage often means lower speed. Find your sweet spot!</li>
                    <li>Stat Synergy: Match your weapon's scaling to your highest stats for maximum pain</li>
                    <li>Proficiency Matters: Don't neglect your weapon skills. Every point counts!</li>
                    <li>Bleed is Your Friend: For sustained damage, bleed effects can be a game-changer</li>
                    <li>Speed Kills: Sometimes, a faster weapon with lower damage can outperform a slow heavy-hitter
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Fun Facts to Impress Your Friends</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Changing stances doesn't affect swing speed. It's all about that base (speed)!</li>
                    <li>The weapon with the highest base damage? Hivelord's Hubris and Divine Greatsword, both at a
                        whopping 30!</li>
                    <li>The fastest swing speed belongs to the Divine Dagger at 1.3x. It's basically teleporting at this
                        point.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Conclusion: Knowledge is Power (and Damage)</h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding weapon mechanics in Deepwoken isn't just for the nerds (though we love you, nerds!).
                    It's about maximizing your potential and becoming a true weapon master. Whether you're calculating
                    optimal DPS or just trying to figure out why your sword feels like a wet noodle, remember: in
