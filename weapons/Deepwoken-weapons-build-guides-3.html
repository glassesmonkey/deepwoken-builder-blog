                <p>
                    What's up, Deepwoken warriors? üëã Ready to dive into the world of "just right" weapons? Today we're
                    talking medium weapons in Deepwoken - the Goldilocks of the weapon world. Not too light, not too
                    heavy,
                    these bad boys are all about that sweet, sweet balance!
                </p>

                <h2>Why Medium Weapons Rock in Deepwoken</h2>
                <p>
                    Medium weapons are like that friend who's good at everything - they've got a bit of everything going
                    for them:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Balanced Speed and Power: Hit hard without feeling like you're swinging a tree</li>
                    <li>Versatility: One-handed? Two-handed? Why not both?</li>
                    <li>Range: Keep enemies at a comfortable "you can't hit me but I can hit you" distance</li>
                    <li>Variety: From stabby spears to bonk-tastic clubs, there's something for everyone</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Fantastic Four of Medium Weapons</h2>
                <h3>1. Swords: The All-Rounders</h3>
                <p>
                    Ah, swords - the weapon of choice for heroes and edgy anime protagonists everywhere.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Top Pick: Serpent's Edge (75 MED, 15% penetration - slice through armor like butter!)</li>
                    <li>Pro Tip: Master the art of switching between one-handed and two-handed stances for maximum
                        flexibility</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Spears: The Pokey Bois</h3>
                <p>
                    For when you want to keep your enemies at arm's length... plus a few more feet.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Top Pick: Rifle Spear (80 MED, 25% penetration - it's a spear AND a gun, what's not to love?)
                    </li>
                    <li>Pro Tip: Use that sweet, sweet range to poke enemies before they can even think about hitting
                        you</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Clubs: The Bonk Masters</h3>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, you just want to hit things really hard. Enter the club.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Top Pick: Pernach (75 MED, 30% penetration - it's like a mace, but angrier)</li>
                    <li>Pro Tip: Great for dealing with heavily armored foes - armor doesn't mean much when you're being
                        bonked!</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. Rifles: The Shooty-Stabby Hybrid</h3>
                <p>
                    For those who can't decide between melee and ranged combat. Why not both?
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Top Pick: Iron Blunderbuss (75 MED, 25% penetration - when you absolutely, positively need to
                        shoot AND stab someone)</li>
                    <li>Pro Tip: Use the gun blast to create space, then close in with melee attacks. It's like a deadly
                        dance!</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Medium Weapon Mechanics: The Nitty-Gritty</h2>
                <p>
                    Let's get a bit technical (but not too technical, we're not writing a thesis here):
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Damage: Generally higher than light weapons, lower than heavy weapons (duh)</li>
                    <li>Swing Speed: The Goldilocks zone - not too fast, not too slow</li>
                    <li>Scaling: Often scales well with MED stat, making them great for balanced builds</li>
                    <li>Stance Switching: Many medium weapons can switch between one-handed and two-handed stances</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Pro Strats for Medium Weapon Users</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Master Stance Switching: Be unpredictable! Switch it up to confuse your enemies</li>
                    <li>Use Your Range: Medium weapons often have better range than light weapons - use it!</li>
                    <li>Mix It Up: Combine light attacks, heavy attacks, and special moves for deadly combos</li>
                    <li>Don't Forget Your Offhand: When one-handing, use shields or offhand weapons for extra oomph</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Conclusion: Embrace the Balance!</h2>
                <p>
                    Medium weapons in Deepwoken are all about versatility and balance. They're the Swiss Army knives of
