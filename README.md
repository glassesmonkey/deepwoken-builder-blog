# Deepwoken Builder

Welcome to the Deepwoken Builder project! This tool is designed to help users create and customize builds for the game Deepwoken. The project is built with static HTML and JavaScript, and can be easily set up and run locally.

## Demo

Check out the live demo of the Deepwoken Builder [here](https://deepwokenbuilder.com).

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/deepwoken-builder.git](https://github.com/glassesmonkey/deepwoken-builder-blog.git)
   cd deepwoken-builder
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the project:**
   You can use a local server to serve the static files. One simple way is to use the [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) package:
   ```bash
   npx http-server
   ```

   This will start a server and provide you with a URL (usually `http://localhost:8080`) where you can view the project in your browser.

## Usage

Once the project is running, open your browser and navigate to the URL provided by the local server (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`). You should see the Deepwoken Builder interface, where you can start creating and customizing your builds.
