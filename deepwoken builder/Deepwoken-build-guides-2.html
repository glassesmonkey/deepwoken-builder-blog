                <h2>Weapon Smackdown: Compare and Conquer üí™</h2>

                <p>
                    Ever wondered which weapon would win in a fight? Well, wonder no more! Our Deepwoken build maker lets you pick two weapons and see how they stack up against each other. Here's how it works:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Go to the "Weapons" tab in our <a href="../index.html">Deepwoken build maker</a></li>
                    <li>Pick your first weapon from the dropdown menu</li>
                    <li>Choose a second weapon to compare it with</li>
                    <li>Hit the "Calculate Damage" button</li>
                    <li>Watch the magic happen as we show you all the juicy details!</li>
                </ol>

                <p>We'll show you stuff like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Base damage</li>
                    <li>Scaled damage (based on your character's stats)</li>
                    <li>Effective damage (taking into account penetration)</li>
                    <li>Bleed damage (if your weapon can make enemies go "ouch" over time)</li>
                    <li>Total damage (the whole shebang!)</li>
                    <li>DPS (Damage Per Second, for when you need to know how fast you can smash things)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    But wait, there's more! We don't just give you boring numbers. We make it fun with colorful charts that show you exactly how your weapons compare. It's like a boxing match, but with swords and axes!
                </p>

                <h2>The Secret Sauce: Our Damage Formula üß™</h2>

                <p>
                    Now, you might be wondering, "How do you guys figure out all this damage stuff?" Well, we've got a super smart (but not too complicated) formula that takes into account things like:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Your weapon's base damage</li>
                    <li>Your character's attributes</li>
                    <li>Weapon proficiency (how good you are with the weapon)</li>
                    <li>Any special stars or bonuses your weapon has</li>
                    <li>Extra penetration (for when you really want to punch through armor)</li>
                    <li>Bleed chance (because sometimes, it's fun to watch them suffer)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    We mix all these ingredients in our magical Deepwoken build maker cauldron, and out pops your damage numbers!
                </p>

                <h2>Pro Tips for Deepwoken Build Maker Masters üß†</h2>

                <ol>
                    <li>Don't be afraid to experiment! Try weird weapon combos - you might discover something awesome</li>
                    <li>Pay attention to the scaling on weapons. Sometimes a weaker weapon can become a beast if it scales well with your stats</li>
                    <li>Use the charts to spot trends. Maybe one weapon is better for quick hits, while another is best for big, slow smashes</li>
                    <li>Remember, the best weapon is the one that fits your playstyle. Our Deepwoken build maker helps you find it!</li>
                </ol>
